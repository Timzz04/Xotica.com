# Exotic Animal Sightings App - Roadmap

## Project Overview
This app allows users to report sightings of exotic animals, including details such as location, time, and other relevant information. Users can submit sightings, while administrators can manage and validate the reports through an administrator panel. The app will support multiple roles for efficient management and verification.

## Features
### 1. User Reporting Interface
- Users can report sightings by submitting:
  - Animal species
  - Date and time of sighting
  - Location (GPS/Map integration)
  - Additional description or notes
  - Picture uploads

### 2. Administrator Panel
- Administrators will have access to:
  - Review and approve reported sightings
  - View sightings on a map
  - Filter sightings by date, species, or location
  - Manage reported data (approve, flag, delete)
  - Role-based access (Admin, Super Admin)

### 3. Role Management
- **Users**: Can report sightings and view the public map
- **Administrators**: Manage sighting data
- **Super Admins**: Manage administrators and system settings

### 4. Data Management & Security
- Store sightings data securely in a database
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Image storage for uploaded photos of sightings

### 5. Notifications
- Push notifications for sighting approval or new sightings in the area

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Django/Flask for API and admin panel
- **Database**: Firebase, MongoDB, or SQL for sightings data and user management
- **Maps Integration**: Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap for sighting locations
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth or OAuth

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Project scaffolding (frontend and backend)
- Set up authentication (Firebase/Auth system)
- Basic reporting functionality (user role, report sightings)

### Phase 2: Database and Backend Development
- Database setup for storing sightings and user data
- API development to handle user reports, admin actions, and role management

### Phase 3: Administrator Panel
- Create an administrator panel for sighting management
- Implement role-based access and permissions

### Phase 4: Maps & GPS Integration
- Integrate map functionality for users to report sighting locations
- Allow admins to view reported sightings on a map

### Phase 5: Testing & Security
- Implement security protocols (authentication, data validation)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, user testing)

### Phase 6: Notifications & Push Updates
- Implement push notifications for sighting updates
- Notifications for admins and users based on sightings

### Phase 7: Finalizing & Deployment
- Optimize for mobile platforms (iOS/Android)
- Prepare for deployment to app stores
